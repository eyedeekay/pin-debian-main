Description: Forces the installation of i2p packages from Debian.
 Stops apt from trying to fetch the i2p package from the PPA and Project-hosted
 sources when they conflict.
 This causes the system to blacklist i2p and i2pd from the project sources and
 force them to replaced with the ones from the distribution. Also it means that
 it will *never* be eligible for upstreaming to Debian, but that's OK  because
 unless you have the PPA installed, you don't need it.
