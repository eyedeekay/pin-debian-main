pin-debian-main for Debian
-------------------------

This causes the system to blacklist i2p and i2pd from the project sources and
force them to replaced with the ones from the distribution. **Also it means**
**that it will *never* be eligible for upstreaming to Debian, but that's OK**
**because unless you have the PPA installed, you don't need it.**
